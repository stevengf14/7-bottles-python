# 7_bottles
It's an adaptation of the Problem of 7 bottles, using genetic algorithm in Python

The problem:
You have 21 bottles of wine. 7 full, 7 half full and 7 empty. And you must distribute to 3 people so that each one has the same amount of wine and the same number of bottles.

To test:
The problem request an initial population, the number of iterations, the mutation probability and the cost or fitness that you expect

Population: The algorithm generates a random number of individuals that represent a solution.
Iterations: The populations will reproduce with its best individuals and will sometimes mutate. This process is carried out during n iterations.
Mutation: A random number is compared with the mutation probability and only in this case, it generates new individuals.
Cost/Fitness: The perfect solution will cost 20. But you can enter a different cost to stop the process.
